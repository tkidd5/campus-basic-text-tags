                <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>
                    <p>When you have text that is displayed in a block, usually with multiple lines, it's considered a paragraph. Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are emphasized in some way, and they can contain links and other markup used for text (but not headings). <em>Paragraphs are block-level elements.</em></p>
                    <p>It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires some special formatting. You'd need to ensure that each line displayed at a proper length, and you can do that with the line break tags. These <strong>will not</strong> be used outside of that purpose or for formatting an address in an address tag. Don't add line breaks to paragraphs, forms, or other page elements. use CSS for styling.</p>
                    <p>Remember that you can use tags like <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to convey meaning in text (these are not just to make text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>, they add meaning).</p>
